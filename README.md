# Lamppost

Ever see a lamppost or a kiosk with helpful information on it? Well this app is a digital version! To start off it will be a cooler place to store your contacts and also view local emergency and take out food numbers. Then we'll add anything that helps people!

### Architcture

The dashboard of the Lamppost is called the user's post. Its a scroll view where you can add an arbitrary amount of subviews called flyers. A flyer can be anything from a single contact (e.g. Mom) to a group of contacts, a link to a location to open a navigation app, a useful website, etc...

The most iportant parts of this project are helping people and to experimenting with cool UI designs. So play around as long as your UI looks nice and fresh.
